# Dr. Jams

Dr. Jams isn't your typical discord bot!
Using the messages you type, Dr. Jams is able to talk inside of a discord VC.

In other words, Dr. Jams is a TTS (Text-To-Speech) bot.

Originally this bot was going to be programmed in Rust using Serenity, however, I couldn't find a library that would allow me to use discord VCs.
<br>Instead I rewrote the bot in Python. 

The current version of the bot is using Discord.py.


# Setup

Here is a google doc containing all the steps needed to setup this discord bot.
